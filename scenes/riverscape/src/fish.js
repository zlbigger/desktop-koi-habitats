//
// Three senses find the food, with three ranges and three latencies, and the stagger
// between them is what makes an arrival read as animals rather than as a particle system.
// The lateral line feels the pellets hit the film from most of the tank away and answers
// first: the behavioural reaction of a surface-feeding fish to a wave is 128 ms at large
// amplitude and 242 ms at threshold (Bleckmann 1980, doi:10.1007/BF00606308). What it
// gives is coarse -- these characins have none of the cephalic neuromast array of the
// surface specialists that was measured on, so the splash is a direction to look in and
// nothing more, and how wrong that direction is has never been measured. Sight gives a
// particular pellet: a planktivore of this size reacts to 1 to 3 mm prey from 13 to 19 cm
// away in clear water (Utne 1997, doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.1997.tb01619.x), and FEED.sight
// is 16 cm of that band. It is a chance per second that climbs as a pellet nears, never a
// radius every fish crosses on the same frame. Smell is last and worst: the plume only
// goes where the water goes, so a fish downstream meets it ten or twenty seconds late
// with nothing to aim at, and searches by nosing upstream into the flow, which is how

// outlasts the fast one by minutes. Keeping both is what stops the tank reading as a
// switch being flipped. Real appetitive hunting stays strongly elevated for a quarter of
// an hour and is back to baseline by about thirty minutes (Wee et al. 2019,
// doi:10.7554/eLife.43775); that envelope would make feeding the tank's default rather
// than an event, so the intense phase is compressed hard and the tail is kept long. The
// compression is deliberate and is the one number here knowingly taken away from the

// A fish that has found food is a far louder signal than a 1 mm pellet: it accelerates,

// and grouped fish feed sooner than lone ones -- measured in neon tetra across groups of
// one to ten (Saxby et al. 2010, doi:10.1016/j.applanim.2010.04.008). This is the alarm
// contagion again, at a longer range, an order of magnitude slower, and graded rather
// than all-or-nothing, because it is appetite and not reflex. A recruit aims at the fish

// Zebrafish chase evasive prey at 13 cm/s, nearly four body lengths a second (Nair et al.

// stationary. So the fish rushes to the neighbourhood, brakes hard on its pectorals, and
// closes the last body length slowly and deliberately -- and the slow part is not
// timidity. A 1 mm pellet has no inertia worth the name and is pushed by the water the
// fish itself is shoving ahead of it, a field that is self-similar in approach speed and
// gone by about a body length ahead (Stewart et al. 2014, doi:10.1242/jeb.111773), so a
// fish that comes in fast blows its own dinner away and a fish that stalks does not. How
// many millimetres of shove that is worth has never been published; FORAGE.bowWave is
// tuned by eye until a full-speed pass usually loses the pellet. Pursuit is proportional

// zebrafish of 3.4 cm, this fish's size class exactly: strikes launched from a median
// 6.9 mm with a spread of 4.4 to 10.7 mm, and no capture ever succeeding from beyond
// 10.4 mm (Nair et al. 2017). A real strike lasts 42 ms, which is two and a half frames
// and invisible, so it is rendered over about 110 ms instead -- a declared concession, and
// the only place here where legibility is put above the measurement. Misses are not
// rolled for. They come out of the geometry: a hurried fish's aim is worse, its bow wave
// has moved the pellet, it over-lunges or falls short, or a neighbour's jaws get there
// first. Mouthing and spitting an item out is not a glitch either -- adult zebrafish spit
// pellets routinely, even edible ones, and orient the spit away from their neighbours
